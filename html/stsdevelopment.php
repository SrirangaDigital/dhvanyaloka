  <h3>Science, Technology and Sustainable Development</h3>
  <p>The course intends to provide a forum for examining the developmental ethos of India.  India, which historically had a strong tradition in Science and Technology has emerged as the most popular democracy coming to terms with the developmental realities.  While the social and ecological impacts of conventional development makes it imperative to seek sources and sustainable alternatives, roots of such alternatives and practices can still be seen in India.</p>
