  <h3>Sarasa</h3>
<p>Sarasa founded by CN Srinath in 2000 is probably the only journal in India devoted exclusively to creative translation from Indian languages into English. It has so for published various writers, both classical and contemporary from Punjabi, Oriya, Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, Telugu, Sanskrit and other languages with a focus on younger contemporary writers of both promise and achievement. </p>
<p>It is good to remind ourselves that no theory has generated creativity though it may have helped us in organizing our perception of it.  Hence the focus will largely be on actual translation.  But there will be a discussion of actual professional/practitionerâ€™s specific problems, for example translation of cultural words and phrases from our languages into English, expressions that have a local scent and flavour, a halo of historical past, the heft and load of layers of meaning embedded into it.</p>
<p>It is only the specific that can contribute something to the general..  </p>
<p>Annual subscription for the Bi-annual is - individuals and institutions: Rs.300/-, foreign $15.00 (airmail  postage free). Contributions are invited.</p>
